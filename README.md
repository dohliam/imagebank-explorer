# ASP Image Bank Explorer 
This is a lightweight tool to explore the open-licensed images in the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org/) using keywords derived from the stories themselves.

## Usage
Just type keywords into the search box. Try a few simple words like ["bird"](https://global-asp.github.io/imagebank/?bird), ["cat"](https://global-asp.github.io/imagebank/?cat), ["tree"](https://global-asp.github.io/imagebank/?tree), ["lion"](https://global-asp.github.io/imagebank/?lion), or ["river"](https://global-asp.github.io/imagebank/?river) to get a sense of what sort of images can be found.

Specific image searches can be linked to directly by using the simple API -- just add your term after a question mark appended to the end of the URL, e.g.:

    https://global-asp.github.io/imagebank/?elephant

Attribution and license information for individual images can be displayed by hovering over the search image results.

## Supported languages
The [ASP image bank](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-imagebank) was created as a side effect of generating extracting source stories for the [Global African Storybook Project](https://global-asp.github.io/).

A [corpus of English ASP texts](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-source) has been used to create the wordlist for this tool as a proof-of-concept, however support will be added soon for all the languages included in both the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org/) and [Global African Storybook Project](https://global-asp.github.io/).

Potentially, any language can be supported. If a language is not currently included, it can be added by first contributing translations of stories into that language to one of the two ASP projects in order to create a corpus of translated text.
