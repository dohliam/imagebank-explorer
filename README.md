# ASP Image Bank Explorer 
This is a lightweight tool to explore the open-licensed images in the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org/) using keywords derived from the stories themselves.

## Usage
Just type keywords into the search box. Try a few simple words like "bird", "cat", "tree", "lion", or "river" to get a sense of what sort of images can be found.

## Supported languages
The [image bank](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-imagebank) was created as a side effect of generating the stories for the [Global African Storybook Project](https://global-asp.github.io/).

A corpus of English ASP texts has been used to create the wordlist for this tool as a proof-of-concept, however support will be added soon for all the languages included in both the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org/) and [Global African Storybook Project](https://global-asp.github.io/).

Potentially, any language can be supported. If a language is not currently included, it can be added by first contributing translations of stories into that language to one of the two ASP projects in order to create a corpus of translated text.

There are a small number of Afrikaans, Swahili, and other language keywords included in the corpus due to bilingual or mis-tagged stories. These will be cleaned up in a future version adding proper support for searching in these languages.
